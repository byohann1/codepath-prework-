-> App Brainstorming:
If i was to creat an app i would creat an educational app that is designed to help users learn the amharic language through interactive lessons, audio pronuciation, and visual cues. The app will include beginner to intermediate vocabulary, everyday phrases and cultural context. Most of the key features will include flashcards with audio, quizzes, stories and daily challenges. The goal is to make learning amharic fun, engaging and accessible for both advanvced speakers and complete beginners.

## Notes

Surprisingly i did not come into any issue when creating this app.
